## Ideas

## Diversifiers I want to do:
- **GAG10** - Celebrate the 10th anniversary of http://www.gameaccessibilityguidelines.com by implementing 10 guidelines from the s
- **Stress Free** - Give the player an option to play with the difficult greatly reduced (e.g. no enemies, no timer)
- **Take A Break** - Each member of the team has to take at least one break every 2-3 hours.
- **Rhyme or Reason** - All of your in-game dialog/text/speech must rhyme.
- - **All that Jazz** - Use a music piece from prior to 1923 in your game. All sound recordings fixed before 1923 will enter the public domain in the U.S. see https://www.copyright.gov/music-modernization/
